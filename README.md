# cookiecutter-django-lite

Welcome to cookiecutter-django-lite, a streamlined Django template that enables you to quickly set up a Django-based microservice or API. It's inspired by [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django) but aims to offer a more lightweight starting point.

## Features

* **Database Configuration**: Choose between SQLite or PostgreSQL for your database needs.
* **RESTful Configuration**: Django REST framework (DRF) is integrated by default, so you can start building your RESTful API right away.
* **API Schema with drf-spectacular**: Swagger UI comes out-of-the-box for easy API documentation and interaction.
* **Sample App**: A minimal sample application (`sample_app`) is included to demonstrate how to work with Django and DRF. This can be used as a starting point, extended, or removed altogether.

## Why This Project?

The goal is to make it as simple as possible to quickly build microservices with Django. This project was inspired by [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django), but we wanted to eliminate some of the additional boilerplate that comes with it.

Additionally, this template aims to be a drop-in replacement for FastAPI. It provides many of the same features, allowing Django developers to reap the benefits of FastAPI without having to leave the comfort of the Django framework.

## Quick Start

1. Install cookiecutter if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install cookiecutter
   ```
   
2. Generate a new Django project:
   ```bash
   cookiecutter gh:yourusername/cookiecutter-django-lite
   ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your new project.

4. Change directory into your newly created project folder and run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

That's it! Your new Django project should be up and running.
